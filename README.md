> Personal website / blog, attempt 4.

I've always wanted my own blog, somewhere to post stories about whatever I'm doing, whether that be programming, gaming or a holiday.

I always got stuck on the backend, finding issues of where to host the service, how to host static files, etc...  
The backend always took away from the creative aspect of programming - seeing your code come to life.

Hopefully with GitHub handling backend services, I should be a lot more "free". We'll see.
